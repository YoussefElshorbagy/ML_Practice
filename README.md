## End-to-End Machine Learning Project? Potentially? Hopefully?


#### A reusable modular Machine Learning End-to-End project that includes:

  -  EDA and Feature Engineering
  -  Data Ingestion
  -  Data Transformation
  -  Model training, hyper-parameter tuning, and selection
  -  Prediction pipeline including very basis Flask frontend that accepts datapoints for prediction
  -  Logging and Exception Handling


* Added more elegant Streamlit front end:
  - Activate the local environment
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - In terminal: streamlit run main.py
  - Should open automatically in your browser
 
* Ugly Flask frontend is still there:
  - Activate the local environment
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - In terminal: python app.py
  - http://localhost:5000/
